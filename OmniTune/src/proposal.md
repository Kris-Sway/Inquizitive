# react-project

Created by Kristopher Noel and Josue Molina.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, OmniTune is for lovers of any genre of music. It allows users to choose music from every genre, for people who may be interested in looking for new genres of music and playlists within those genres to listen to.

## API & React Router

This application will use the (https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1.) API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: (https://binaryjazz.us/genrenator-api/?ref=apilist.fun)
https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/genre/
  - This will fetch an array of music genres
  - For each genre, I want the `id` and `title`
  - When a specific genre is selected, it will then direct to a list of subgenres in that genre
  - Based on the genre you choose it will fetch a playlist of that genre from Spotify
  https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/story/ 
  - This will return an array of stories.
  - Each endpoint can be fed an additional parameter if you want more than one result returned.

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/home` page, users can see all the genres of music
* On the `/home` page, there will be a nav bar to see the lists of genres, and then click to see the subgenres and playlists
* On the `/home` page, users can search for genres and artists

**Example:**
- On the `/artworks` page, users can view a grid of all artwork
- On the `/artworks` page, users can click on a piece of art in the grid, taking them to the details page for that piece of art.
- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
- On the `/` page, users can search for artwork titles related to a search term.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Users will be able to save their favorite genres
* Users will be able to save and view their favorite artists
* Users will be able to view suggestions of playlists they might like

**Example:**
* Users will be able to save and view favorited artworks using local storage
* Users will be able to change the color scheme of the website from light mode to dark mode
